# Installation

- Install ganache-cli `npm install -g ganache@v7.0.0-alpha.2`
- Install Docker
- Install Go 1.6. Make sure GOPATH, GOROOT are set and go module is turned on.

# Errors you might face.
- This repository currently depends on other private repositories in the sisu-network organization. Run `make configure-git` to tell git to clone those repositories over SSH.

# Generate Mock structs

- Install mockgen to generate mock structs from interfaces:

```bash
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
```

# From the sisu root folder

## Create env file

```
cp .env.dev .env
```

## Run the sisu app.

Install all modules.
```
go mod tidy
```

Generate config file and genesis for local sisu app:

```
./scripts/gen_localnet.sh
```

To run the app on localhost:

```
./scripts/run_local.sh
```

You can now deploy ETH transaction on ganache1 at port 7545.

### Running with TSS (single node) one command line
---

You will need at least 5 different terminal tabs to run a full Sisu nodes: 2 tabs for ganache-cli, 1 for dheart, 1 for deyes, 1 for sisu.

## Run ganache-cli
---

Download ganache (make sure you have version **7.x with node 14** and above) and runs the following commands on 2 different terminals:

```
ganache-cli --accounts 10 --blockTime 3 --port 8545 --defaultBalanceEther 100000 --chain.networkId 189985 --chain.chainId 189985 --mnemonic "draft attract behave allow rib raise puzzle frost neck curtain gentle bless letter parrot hold century diet budget paper fetch hat vanish wonder maximum"
```

```
ganache-cli --accounts 10 --blockTime 3 --port 8545 --defaultBalanceEther 100000 --chain.networkId 189986 --chain.chainId 189986 --mnemonic "draft attract behave allow rib raise puzzle frost neck curtain gentle bless letter parrot hold century diet budget paper fetch hat vanish wonder maximum"
```

These commands create a simulated blockchain on port 7545 and 8545.

## Run dheart and deyes
---

Runs dheart and deyes in 2 separate tabs using their instruction in the repos.

## Run Sisu
---

```
./scripts/run_local.sh
```

## Interact with Sisu
---

Sisu has a number of commands for you to interact with the network. At the root folder, type `./sisu` to see a list of command options. Most of them are default commands from Cosmos SDK. We are only interested in `./sisu dev` command for local dev.

After the start of Sisu, wait until the sisu log has the following message similar to the following:

```
adding watcher address 0x1D156a3e1356b58733305e670D61018001997f6E
```

Please note that `0x1D156a3e1356b58733305e670D61018001997f6E` could be replaced by another address. It's the address of the signing key that Sisu network controls. We need to fund that address with some ETH so that Sisu can have balance to deploy contracts and invoke function calls.

Alternatively, you can connect to mysql and see the address of the generate key in the `keygen` table. Mysql Workbench is good GUI tool to view and edit myqsl data.

```
./sisu dev fund-account ganache1 7545 ganache2 8545 10
```

This commands will fund Sisu's signing key account with 10 ethereum. The last number in the command is the amount you want to fund.

Waits for 10 seconds for the transaction to finalized and for Sisu to deploy its gateway contract.

### Deploy ERC20 token and do token swapping

You can now deploy ERC20 and do token swapping with the repo [smart-contract](https://github.com/sisu-network/smart-contracts).


## Running with TSS (multi nodes) using docker

This section describes how to run sisu (multiple nodes) using docker. This simulates a real network operation using various services in docker container. Each node 3 instances: sisu, dheart, deyes services in the container in addition to 2 ganaches (to simulate at least 2 chains) and a mysql instance.

Because of high number of services in the docker container (3 x n + 3 where n is the number of validators in the network), it's recommended that you run TSS with single node (in the following section) for faster local development speed and do extensive unit tests. You can use docker for testing full multi nodes with TSS enabled.

## Build containers

You need to build sisu, dheart, deyes, ganache images in their corresponding repos. Assume that you save dheart, deyes in the same directory level with sisu.

```
./scripts/docker_build_all.sh
```

## Generate data
Next, generate docker-compose file and data for all nodes in the network.
```
go build -o ./sisu cmd/sisud/main.go
./sisu local-docker --v 2 --output-dir ./output
```

## Run docker-compose
Go the generate folder and start all services using docker-compose
```
cd output
docker-compose up -d
```

You can check logs for each services using `docker-compose logs`. For example:
```
docker-compose logs -f sisu0
```

The ganache cli instances expose 2 ports to the host machine: 7545 and 7546. You can interact with the blockchain through this port.

To fund accounts generated by Sisu network, use `fund-account command`
```
./sisu dev fund-account ganache1 7545 ganache2 8545 10
```

To create an ERC20 contract:
```
./sisu dev deploy-erc20 7545
```
This will deploy an ERC20 contract and its address is shown in the console.

To transfer token cross chain:
```
./sisu dev transfer-out erc20 ganache1 7545 [ERC20 contract address] ganache2 [Recipient address]
```

To close all services:
```
docker-compose down
```

NOTE: if you get into bad data state or you want to reset the blockchain, simply run the local-docker command again
```
./sisu local-docker --v 2 --output-dir ./output
```
